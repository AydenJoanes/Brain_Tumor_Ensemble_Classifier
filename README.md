# Brain_Tumor_Ensemble_Classifier
This project implements a deep learning-based brain tumor detection system trained on MRI images. Using an ensemble of three pretrained CNNs (ResNet18, EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV3), it classifies tumors into four categories: glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor with 88% accuracy.
